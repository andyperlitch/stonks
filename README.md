## Adding to GraphQL

1. Add the schema changes to `src/graphql/schema/*-schema.ts` files
1. Ensure the server is running
1. Run `npm run generate`
1. Import `QueryResolvers` from `src/types/graphql-types.ts`, reference the correct resolver with bracket notation, e.g. `QueryResolvers['me']`
1. Attach to `src/graphql/resolvers/root-resolver.ts`
